              The Central Placement Cell, University of Delhi has entered the eighth year of its inception. All the seven
batches registered with CPC in past have duly benefited from Industry- Students interaction. Corporate houses
from different sectors have participated in our endeavor and recruited large number of students from the
university and its colleges during these seven years. We express our gratitude towards these companies for
reposing faith in our students and selecting them. We further wish to nurture this relationship by extending the
data base to include Ph.D/Post Graduate/Under Graduate students along with the students from School of Open
Learning/Non-Collegiate Women Education Board. This pool extends to all Delhi University Colleges and Post
Graduate Departments. The CPC certainly ensures a wider choice in terms of number and quality of students
available at a single platform.
The vision of CPC is to provide a continuum of opportunities to the undergraduate, post graduate students and
research scholars studying in various courses of Science (Physical, Life and Applied sciences), Mathematical
Sciences, Commerce and Social Sciences. A detailed list of courses offered by the University of Delhi is
available on the university website. The Central Placement Cell seeks the support of all corporate houses and
NGO’s in our endeavor to provide suitable placements to our students and help them in their competencies
enhancement.
University of Delhi also appreciates corporates in their endeavor to encourage recruitment of Differently Abled
Students. We also invite your company to participate in Internship Programme for I & II year students.
We would be extremely happy if you / your organization would come forward and support the initiative of the
University as an esteemed partner in this activity. A very large number of students form different Colleges of
Delhi University and Departments are registered under one umbrella.
